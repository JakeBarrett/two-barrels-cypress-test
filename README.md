Hey Two Barrels ðŸ‘‹
This is a Cypress automated test that runs a smoke test on your website. The test checks that each page loads successfully,
and that a UI element is visible on each page. The test also verifies the functionality of the text boxes on the "Contact Us" 
page. It runs on mobile first, then on desktop. At the end of both tests, it checks the footer to verify if the image of the 
Raptor is visible or not. If the raptor is not visible, the test will fail. Thank you for checking out my code!
